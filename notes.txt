java.net package provides two classes:
Socket (client)
ServerSocket  (server)

Socket Definition: (IP + PORT NUMBER)
A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to.

endpoint: Combination of an IP address and a port number. Every TCP connection can be uniquely identified by its two endpoints. Allowing for multiple connections between host and server. 



1. Implement TCP
2. Server is started on known port: 8989
3. Client - Server IP and Port are provided on the command line
4. Client connects to server - server asks for input - user types username "username = ComNet
5. If a user doesn't have a provided username the server does not accept the user's messages.
6. Once user enters a username this is broadcast to everyone
7. User can now talk - server shares with other clients
8. If user types bye - Server says Good Bye ComNet
9. if a user uses AllUsers server will broadcase list of active users
